Training to code with exercices from cs50 Harvard Uninversity and others exercices from the web

This is a folder will contain all exercices I have done during my professional reconversion as a web programmer.

Most of the exercices come from the online training I am following at cs50 Harvard Uninversity and other exercices taken from the web. 

Each file will be accompanied by a pseudocode file_name.txt where I will explain the step by step I have taken to program my codes or 
do my exercices.

If you want to understand better my programs, I invite you to read the pseudocode of the file of your interest.

Please do not hesitate to post your comments and/or suggestions in order to help me to perform in my learning.

Thank you very much for your attention, and I hope you enjoy my programmes.
