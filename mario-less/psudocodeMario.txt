The exercice commmand for "height" but I decided to add some lines before to ask for the height. The reason is to make my program
more user friendly. Avoiding to ask just "Height: ?"

* Prompt for input
    get_int
        additional logical to make sure that the heights is within the range
            check if the value is not out of the range otherwhise reprompt => considere a loop ie. do while loop
                the condition to validate the range indicated

* Build the pyramide, first left aligned
    a for loop to repeat a block of codes some number of times
        code a program that print out the appropriate number of hashes
            print a new line depending on the height of pyramide and the row number

        .......# dots 7 hash 1
        ......## dots 6 hash 2
        .....### dots 5 hash 3
        ....#### dots 4 hash 4
        ...##### dots 3 hash 5
        ..###### dots 2 hash 6
        .####### dots 1 hash 7
        ######## dots 0 hash 8
